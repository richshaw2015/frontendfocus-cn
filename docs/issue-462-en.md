#### [`:focus-visible` Is Here](https://frontendfoc.us/link/96706/rss "matthiasott.com")

The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class lets you show focus styles only when they are needed, using the same heuristic that the browser uses to decide whether to show the default focus indicator. A good thing for accessibility.
