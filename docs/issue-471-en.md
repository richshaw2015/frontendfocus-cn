#### [The HTTP Archive's 2020 _Web Almanac_](https://frontendfoc.us/link/100380/rss "almanac.httparchive.org")

The excellent Web Almanac (_also [available as a PDF](https://frontendfoc.us/link/100381/rss)_) returns for another year, with a comprehensive look at the current state of the web, all based on real-world data from millions of websites. There’s 22 chapters of analysis in this report, including sections on [CSS](https://frontendfoc.us/link/100382/rss), [JavaScript](https://frontendfoc.us/link/100383/rss), [UX](https://frontendfoc.us/link/100384/rss), [publishing](https://frontendfoc.us/link/100385/rss), [distribution](https://frontendfoc.us/link/100386/rss) and more — so plenty to dig into. _Well worth diving into with a coffee or two over the festive break I reckon_.
