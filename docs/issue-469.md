*来源：**💨 Some Tailwind CSS Quick Bits:***

*来源：Tailwind CSS recently hit 2.0, as such we've found a few related tools that may be of interest if you're using the framework:*

*   [Oceanwind](https://frontendfoc.us/link/99514/rss): Generates atomic styles from Tailwind's shorthand classes, which I assume you would then use in place of Tailwind's CSS as part of a CSS-in-JS solution.

*   [Tailwind Builder](https://frontendfoc.us/link/99515/rss): This (paid) online editor features a drag-and-drop UI and 240+ ready-to-use/customizable components for building out Tailwind sites fast.

*   [UI Devtools](https://frontendfoc.us/link/99516/rss): A unique DevTools extra that bridges the gap between Tailwind's atomic classes and the actual CSS, allowing you to debug your CSS visually using Tailwind's language. Watch a demo [here](https://frontendfoc.us/link/99517/rss). The distribution model is interesting as it's only available to GitHub Sponsors till they reach 100 sponsors, then it'll be open source.

#### [vue-dock-menu: A Dockable Menu Bar for Vue](https://frontendfoc.us/link/99518/rss "github.com")

Certainly an _interesting_ UI concept here. It’s a menu bar, until you drag it to be a sidebar!

#### [Recreating the Netflix Intro Animation in Pure CSS](https://frontendfoc.us/link/99519/rss "dev.to")
